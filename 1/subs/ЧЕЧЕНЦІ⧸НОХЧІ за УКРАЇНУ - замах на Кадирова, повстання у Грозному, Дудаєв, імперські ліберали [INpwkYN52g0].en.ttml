<p begin="00:00:00.280" end="00:00:01.280" style="s2">Glory to the Nation!</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.280" end="00:00:04.680" style="s2">Dzhokhar Dudayev&#39;s battalion defends Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.680" end="00:00:06.680" style="s2">- To say Chechnya, Chechens, Grozny is wrong<br />and incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.680" end="00:00:12.680" style="s2">Chechnya is in fact a huge concentration camp.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.680" end="00:00:15.640" style="s2">Russian propaganda created the image of a<br />Chechen terrorist.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.640" end="00:00:20.600" style="s2">- They eat Russian-speaking children, we were<br />the first to eat, and then you started.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.600" end="00:00:25.800" style="s2">Grozny will be taken in 3 hours, Ukraine in<br />3 days.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:27.560" style="s2">- We see how the Russian army is fighting<br />now without Ukrainians.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.560" end="00:00:28.880" style="s2">It looks very bad.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.880" end="00:00:34.240" style="s2">- If we had received such assistance then,<br />there would have been no such bloodshed in Ukraine today.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:37.160" style="s2">- The Soviet government had been breaking<br />us for 70 years.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.160" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">Until 89 they were absolutely sure that they<br />finally succeeded.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:43.840" style="s2">And what?</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.840" end="00:00:45.040" style="s2">Dzhokhar Dudayev comes and says &quot;Forward,<br />we are going forward&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.040" end="00:00:53.310" style="s2">As long as at least one of us who disagrees<br />with them is alive, as long as at least one</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.310" end="00:00:55.480" style="s2">of you who disagrees with them is alive, they<br />will not succeed.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.480" end="00:00:57.680" style="s2"> Hail to the heroes</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:08.440" style="s2">There will be a massacre in Crimea<br />yet.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.440" end="00:01:10.120" style="s2">Ukraine will still meet Russia on the battlefield.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.120" end="00:01:17.320" style="s2">As long as Russia exists, it will never give<br />up its ambitions.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.320" end="00:01:28.360" style="s2">Now there is Slavic there under this brand,<br />they want to crush Ukraine, Belarus again as in the old days.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:32.080" style="s2">Johar Dudayev spoke these prophetic words<br />in 95.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.080" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">Then people looked at him: &quot;What is he talking<br />about?</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.960" end="00:01:35.960" style="s2">What Ukraine?</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.960" end="00:01:37.960" style="s2">What war?</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.960" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">What is he talking about?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:42.979" style="s2">But these words turned out to be prophetic.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.979" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">At that time he was the president of the independent<br />republic of Ichkeria.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:52.680" style="s2">Ichkeria reduced their appetites, but<br />did not stop them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:58.400" style="s2">And in this video I will tell you about<br />Dudayev&#39;s battalion, which is fighting for the independence of Ukraine and Ichkeria.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.880" style="s2">At the start of this video, I ask you to like,<br />subscribe to the channel and send this video</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.880" end="00:02:08.760" style="s2">to your friends so that it is better recommended<br />and more people learn about Dudayev&#39;s battalion.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.760" end="00:02:12.880" style="s2">By the way, friends, it is wrong to say &quot;Chechens&quot;,<br />&quot;Grozny&quot;, &quot;Chechnya&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.880" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">This topic will be discussed a little further.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:23.000" style="s2">The Russian leadership throughout its<br />history, when it was in trouble, ran to sign</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.000" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">treaties that it has never adhered to, will<br />never adhere to and does not understand what an evil empire Russia is.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">Interviewer: Now in Ukraine people often<br />remember the words of Dudayev, right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:50.920" style="s2">One of the quotes is that Russia will disappear<br />when the Ukrainian sun rises. </p>
<p begin="00:02:50.920" end="00:02:54.920" style="s2">He spoke prophetic words in 95. How do you think he knew all this would happen?</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.920" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">Fighter: Dzhokhar Musayevich Dudayev,<br />the first president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, was a man ahead of his time. </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:12.920" style="s2">That is, he became a general not on the parquet. He was a real general, despite the fact that<br />his nationality would not have allowed him to become a general</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.920" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">but he was able to become<br />a general of the Soviet Army of Strategic Aviation with his talent, his incredible abilities.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">This is, let&#39;s say, the elite in any army<br />in the world. When he said that, he said it as a man </p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">who knew the Russians better than they knew themselves. And what he warned the world about and his</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:42.680" style="s2">words about the Ukrainian sun and his words about the fact that today the war in Chechnya</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.680" end="00:03:47.320" style="s2">is called an internal war, Europe calls an<br />internal affair of Russia, Europe itself will</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.320" end="00:03:49.400" style="s2">become an internal affair of Russia.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">And so it happened in principle.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">Dzhokhar Dudayev had a great respect for the<br />Ukrainian people, for Ukraine, and, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.000" end="00:04:06.440" style="s2">probably, even in Ukraine there are few people,<br />I think, who would believe in Ukrainians so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.440" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">much, who would believe in the spirit, in<br />the strength of this nation, its abilities,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:13.440" style="s2">its future, and he believed.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.440" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">And now we see that all those who said that<br />Kyiv in two days, it was said not only by Russians.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:32.480" style="s2">This was also said by European politicians<br />who believed that it was a matter of a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.480" end="00:04:35.720" style="s2">days, weeks, months, hours.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.720" end="00:04:38.030" style="s2">No, no, now they say something completely<br />different.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.030" end="00:04:39.160" style="s2">That is, in Russia all non-Russians are second<br />class.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.160" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">You said that his nationality<br />would not allow him to become a general, but</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:46.040" style="s2">They have been and will be.<br />he became a general.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.040" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">It was among these non-Russians that they<br />found those who seemed the most loyal to them.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">What prevented him?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:56.920" style="s2">There is a very nice word in<br />the Ukrainian language, which Ukrainians explained to me - minority.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.920" end="00:05:05.000" style="s2">That is, in Russia all non-Russians are second class. They have been and will be. </p>
<p begin="00:05:05.000" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">It was among these non-Russians that they found those who seemed the most loyal to them. </p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">But as we see, these loyal people received<br />education, achieved some goals, but they never</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:18.400" style="s2">ceased to be Ukrainians, Chechens, and it<br />was a big surprise for the colonizers.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:24.040" style="s2">It seemed to them that here he is a general,<br />he will do what we say, and then - once he</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.040" end="00:05:30.440" style="s2">wanted freedom . Because he always wanted<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">5:35: Interviewer: Did you see Dudayev?</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:41.040" style="s2">I was a child, yes, at independence<br />parades and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.040" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">I saw it more on TV screens.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:53.880" style="s2">Now sometimes I watch it on YouTube and I<br />can honestly say that the Chechen people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.880" end="00:05:57.200" style="s2">in such a terrible situation today, because<br />it is gone.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.200" end="00:06:02.040" style="s2">It was the most terrible wound they inflicted<br />on the Chechen people.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.040" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">They deprived them of a leader of such a level.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:12.280" style="s2">6:09: Interviewer: Why did he believe in Ukrainians<br />so much?</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.280" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">Ukrainians fought on your side, did he see<br />something while communicating with them, or</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:21.240" style="s2">was there some other story.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">6:22 Fighter: The relations between the North<br />Caucasus and Chechnya, Ukraine are a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">bit longer than just participation in hostilities.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">The fact is that during the Holodomor, tens<br />of thousands of people, fleeing from hunger,</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:40.360" style="s2">went to the North Caucasus.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.360" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">There was a special operation of the NKVD,<br />which was aimed at finding these Ukrainians</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:48.760" style="s2">and sending them to Siberia.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.760" end="00:06:53.080" style="s2">As I heard from elderly people, these were<br />those who lived in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.080" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">These people understood that they were being<br />sent to Siberia to die, they were sent to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:03.640" style="s2">freezing temperatures, to inhuman living conditions,<br />they hid their children with Chechens, they</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.640" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">were taken to the mountains, and the NKVD<br />was looking for them there.</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">Children were taught the language at an accelerated<br />pace so that they knew the Chechen language.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:21.240" style="s2">So that when the NKVD officers came and asked<br />them in Chechen, they could answer.</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">Many NKVD officers, unfortunately, were also<br />Chechens.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:28.360" style="s2">These children stayed, these children grew<br />up.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.360" end="00:07:33.920" style="s2">Then, in adulthood, they told us who their<br />parents were.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.920" end="00:07:37.080" style="s2">We still have very warm relations with Ukrainians.</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.080" end="00:07:42.680" style="s2">We always separated Russians from Ukrainians.</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.680" end="00:07:49.400" style="s2">And when we came to fight for Chechnya, it<br />was perceived as a natural process.</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.400" end="00:07:52.200" style="s2">7:49 - What are you doing here?</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.200" end="00:07:54.320" style="s2">Sashko Bilyi: We defend the freedom of the<br />Chechen Republic, we fight against Moscow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.320" end="00:07:55.320" style="s2">aggression.</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.320" end="00:07:58.480" style="s2">It was not something strange,<br />it was our courageous brave people.</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.480" end="00:08:04.440" style="s2">Today I hope that in the future, when Chechnya<br />and the whole North Caucasus will be free,</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.440" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">many Ukrainians will come to us and stay here.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:12.880" style="s2">Because I would like to hear the Ukrainian<br />language, to have restaurants serving Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.880" end="00:08:23.720" style="s2">cuisine, to have good warm relations between<br />the North Caucasus and Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.720" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">We have something to give each other, we have<br />something to support each other.</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.000" style="s2">I think it just needs to be developed.</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.000" end="00:08:39.960" style="s2">We have those relations that will never be<br />between Russians and Ukrainians, because we</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.960" end="00:08:40.570" style="s2">do not treat each other as second-class, as<br />Russians do.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.570" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">They fought just as bravely, desperately,<br />and died.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:43.800" style="s2">One close comrade told me a story.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.800" end="00:08:46.820" style="s2">Unfortunately, both among Chechens and Ukrainians<br />there are those who are infected with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.820" end="00:08:52.990" style="s2">During the storming of Grozny, Ukrainians<br />came to the basement of the presidential palace</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.990" end="00:08:53.240" style="s2">from the position, carrying their wounded<br />soldier, and one of those who carried him</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.240" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">colonial imperial propaganda, that they call<br />their &quot;khokhlas&quot;, &quot;churkas&quot;, think in these</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:55.240" style="s2">categories.</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.240" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">I think they will soon leave the historical<br />arena and we will return to normal existence.</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.240" style="s2">was holding his head in his hands, which were<br />covered with blood.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.240" end="00:09:04.390" style="s2">In the Chechen language there are no nicknames<br />for any nations.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.390" end="00:09:07.710" style="s2">And at that time Russian deputies arrived<br />for negotiations.</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.710" end="00:09:13.240" style="s2">This Ukrainian brought his friend into the<br />operating room, came out, smoked, he had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.240" end="00:09:13.350" style="s2">That is, you cannot say &quot;Khokhly&quot; to be understood,<br />you have to say &quot;Ukrainians&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:14.550" style="s2">big red beard.</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.550" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">He had a trace of blood on his beard.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.160" style="s2">A Russian deputy came up, saw a Ukrainian<br />flag on him, asked &quot;Are you Ukrainian?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.160" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">You see, this is very important.<br />He replied: &quot;Yes, I am Ukrainian&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">&quot;So what do you think about what is happening,<br />what are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:32.190" style="s2">9:28 Interviewer: How did Ukrainians prove<br />themselves then, during the Chechen war?</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.190" end="00:09:35.400" style="s2">He answered: &quot;We are here fighting for Ukraine.<br />What was said about Sashko Bilyi?</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.400" end="00:09:37.000" style="s2">While we are fighting here, you will not attack<br />there.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.000" end="00:09:38.440" style="s2">I swear to you,&quot; he said, &quot;the holy jihad<br />that is going on against you, the holy war,</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.440" end="00:09:40.440" style="s2">I heard that they drove the only tank you<br />had...</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.440" end="00:09:42.580" style="s2">Soldier: You know, Ukrainians are very,<br />very good soldiers.</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.580" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">let&#39;s say, is for you to see how well we are<br />fighting.</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:47.300" style="s2">We see how the Russian army is fighting now<br />without Ukrainians.</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.300" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">So when the Ukrainian jihad begins, you will<br />regret that you were born into this world.</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">It is very bad.</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:55.280" style="s2">Ukrainians have always been, are and will<br />be one of the best soldiers in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.280" end="00:09:55.450" style="s2">And when they fought in Chechnya, they fought<br />the same way as Chechens fought.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.450" end="00:09:58.140" style="s2">So tell that to Moscow.</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.140" end="00:10:02.530" style="s2">Well, we have lived to see the Ukrainian jihad,<br />the Ukrainian struggle.</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.530" end="00:10:07.150" style="s2">And today we can observe how the words of<br />that Ukrainian fighter turned out to be prophetic.</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.150" end="00:10:10.960" style="s2">That it is harder for Russians now than ever.</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.960" end="00:10:18.390" style="s2">I think that even in 41 it was not so difficult,<br />because then they were supported by the United</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.390" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">States, allies and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:22.820" style="s2">And now they have treacherously attacked Ukraine<br />for absolutely no reason, for no reason at</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.820" end="00:10:23.820" style="s2">all, to destroy it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.820" end="00:10:26.670" style="s2">It is not just about the seizure of the country<br />and territory.</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.670" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">We are talking about Bucha.</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:30.270" style="s2">This is not some empty words.</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.270" end="00:10:32.950" style="s2">Anyone who doubts can go to Bucha.</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.950" end="00:10:35.650" style="s2">There will be more to come.</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.650" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">And in the final, Mariupol is waiting for<br />us.</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:45.590" style="s2">The country will shudder from the horror,<br />from the number of deaths they brought to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.590" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">this land.</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:49.700" style="s2">Someone can answer the question &quot;Why?&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.700" end="00:10:51.820" style="s2">But simply because there should not be Ukrainians.</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.820" end="00:10:55.070" style="s2">They do not recognize the right of the Ukrainian<br />people to exist.</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.070" end="00:10:58.780" style="s2">They do not recognize the right to exist for<br />the Ukrainian language, culture.</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.780" end="00:11:02.330" style="s2">Do you see what they are doing in the occupied<br />territories?</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.330" end="00:11:04.941" style="s2">Do you see how the Ukrainian language is banned?</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.941" end="00:11:07.400" style="s2">You will see how they bring Russian teachers.</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.400" end="00:11:13.630" style="s2">They are trying to completely eliminate the<br />nation.</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.630" end="00:11:21.870" style="s2">I don&#39;t know, I read about such things as<br />a child in books, when there were some colonial</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.870" end="00:11:25.410" style="s2">wars in the 19th century.</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.410" end="00:11:34.260" style="s2">And then, I do not know such horror, such<br />purposeful hatred, terror towards the people.</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.260" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">13:25 Interviewer: I understand that your<br />people were not surprised by all this, because</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:45.100" style="s2">what they were doing in Ichkeria, in your<br />territory, it was give or take the same as</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.100" end="00:11:47.490" style="s2">it was then, maybe even worse.</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.490" end="00:11:52.670" style="s2">I heard stories when people were torn apart<br />by tanks, people were boiled...</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.670" end="00:11:58.370" style="s2">13:39 A fighter: They do what is normal in<br />their perception of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.370" end="00:12:02.450" style="s2">The more brutal and horrible the executions,<br />the destruction of entire cities, villages,</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.450" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">regions, the more chances they have to win.</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:09.720" style="s2">They are just trying to break the spirit of<br />the people.</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.720" end="00:12:15.620" style="s2">They believe that if they arranged this in<br />Bucha, Ukrainians, looking at it or Mariupol,</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.620" end="00:12:16.620" style="s2">should surrender.</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.620" end="00:12:17.900" style="s2">Because they would surrender.</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.900" end="00:12:23.070" style="s2">If the invaders behaved the same way towards<br />them, they would surrender.</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.070" end="00:12:29.960" style="s2">But they underestimate the will of neither<br />Chechen nor Ukrainian people.</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.960" end="00:12:33.610" style="s2">Chechens have not signed any act of surrender.</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.610" end="00:12:36.550" style="s2">They do not have this piece of paper.</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.550" end="00:12:42.230" style="s2">They have no commander-in-chief of the Armed<br />Forces of Ichkeria or president or acting</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.230" end="00:12:45.700" style="s2">president who would sit down and sign the<br />papers.</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.700" end="00:12:50.110" style="s2">Kadyrov is the same Pasichnyk, Zakharchenko,<br />who was blown up.</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.110" end="00:12:54.170" style="s2">That is, this is a &quot;doll&quot; from their environment,<br />a tame monster.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.170" end="00:12:56.050" style="s2">A dog that they brought, and he is already<br />pretending to be in power</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.050" end="00:13:01.510" style="s2">15:05 Interviewer: Explain how it happened<br />that a man like his father, like him, was</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.510" end="00:13:08.660" style="s2">told to kill as many Russians as possible,<br />and then he became a leader.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.660" end="00:13:10.750" style="s2">How did this happen?</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.750" end="00:13:15.430" style="s2">Did they just sell out or what was the trick?</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.430" end="00:13:18.410" style="s2">15:20 Fighter: I think that Ukrainians could<br />write dissertations on this topic.</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.410" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">Because the number of pro-Russian politicians<br />in Ukraine who have been calling the occupation,</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:26.760" style="s2">the annexation a &quot;civil war&quot; all these years,<br />&quot;it&#39;s all for money, someone there arranged</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.760" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">it, it&#39;s not our war, it&#39;s all the Americans,<br />the French, God, but not Russia&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">Ukrainians saw them every day on their TV<br />screens.</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:37.280" style="s2">They heard it every day, every election these<br />people came out, promised Ukrainians peace,</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.280" end="00:13:41.590" style="s2">prosperity and the opportunity to negotiate<br />with Russia.</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.590" end="00:13:42.590" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.590" end="00:13:46.120" style="s2">These are the same people, do you understand?</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.120" end="00:13:47.960" style="s2">If they came to power tomorrow...</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.960" end="00:13:50.620" style="s2">Do you think Medvedchuk would behave differently<br />than Kadyrov?</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.620" end="00:13:53.180" style="s2">There are such people in every nation.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.180" end="00:13:57.380" style="s2">His father called for killing 150 Russians,<br />promised paradise for it.</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.380" end="00:13:59.790" style="s2">They are ready to say anything to deceive<br />you.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.790" end="00:14:05.180" style="s2">Where necessary, they will be the greatest<br />patriots, but their essence of a traitor does</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.180" end="00:14:06.180" style="s2">not change.</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.180" end="00:14:07.180" style="s2">I would not even call them traitors.</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.180" end="00:14:12.920" style="s2">A traitor is a person who had some ideals,<br />values and then betrayed them.</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.920" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">And Kadyrov, Medvedchuk and others have never<br />had such ideals.</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:20.490" style="s2">They have never respected either Chechnya<br />or Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.490" end="00:14:26.260" style="s2">They did not consider either Chechens or Ukrainians<br />as nations and people.</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.260" end="00:14:32.200" style="s2">They did not believe that we have the right<br />to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.200" end="00:14:33.890" style="s2">our language, culture, independence, freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.890" end="00:14:35.910" style="s2">They have always been for Russia.</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.910" end="00:14:37.260" style="s2">They are pure enemy.</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.260" end="00:14:39.290" style="s2">There is no room for doubt.</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.290" end="00:14:44.010" style="s2">Just because he speaks Chechen or has Ukrainian<br />citizenship, a person cannot be considered</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.010" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">a Chechen, a Ukrainian and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:53.270" style="s2">As for those who are ready to fight for Ukraine,<br />to give their lives for it from other countries</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.270" end="00:14:55.580" style="s2">and peoples who do not have Ukrainian citizenship...</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.580" end="00:15:01.850" style="s2">I have always had a dream that many people<br />who come here...</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.850" end="00:15:06.200" style="s2">For example, just yesterday I read the news<br />that Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, some other states</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.200" end="00:15:10.190" style="s2">announced that those who will fight in Ukraine<br />will have problems at home.</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.190" end="00:15:12.750" style="s2">And those who fight for Ukraine will not be<br />able to return home.</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.750" end="00:15:20.670" style="s2">I do not want to hand out citizenship left<br />and right, but I would like the Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.670" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">Council, the authorities to make some kind<br />of passport of honor.</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:33.020" style="s2">With this passport a person would be able<br />to live, work, study, fight for this country.</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.020" end="00:15:37.770" style="s2">But this person would still understand that<br />he/she is a guest.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.770" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">For example, they would not be able to vote<br />in elections, to be elected, to serve in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.050" end="00:15:48.350" style="s2">police and special services.</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.350" end="00:15:51.820" style="s2">It is like gratitude from the Ukrainian people<br />to you for fighting.</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.820" end="00:15:56.980" style="s2">Live among us, learn, earn money, pay taxes,<br />follow our laws.</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.980" end="00:16:00.020" style="s2">But politics is the work of Ukrainians.</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.020" end="00:16:05.500" style="s2">No politician can take a war hero and make<br />him a deputy.</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.500" end="00:16:08.340" style="s2">You know how it works in Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.340" end="00:16:16.100" style="s2">I would like very much that no one in the<br />world would interfere in the internal affairs</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.100" end="00:16:17.100" style="s2">of Ukrainians.</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.960" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">In general, there is no such word &quot;Chechens&quot;<br />in our language, it is a Russian word.</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.520" end="00:19:00.810" style="s2">Like a Chechen lives there, and how so.</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.810" end="00:19:03.190" style="s2">They hear about it every day.</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.190" end="00:19:06.120" style="s2">As Hitler said, &quot;Tell a lie 100 times, it<br />will remain a lie.</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.120" end="00:19:09.049" style="s2">Tell a lie a million times, and then it will<br />become the truth&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.049" end="00:19:10.120" style="s2">It is exactly the same here.</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.120" end="00:19:11.430" style="s2">Propaganda goes on every day.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.430" end="00:19:15.320" style="s2">You show the same thing, everyone tells you<br />the same thing, of course, you start to believe</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.320" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:17.320" style="s2">Interviewer: Do you communicate with the Kadyrovites<br />at all?</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.320" end="00:19:20.840" style="s2">Is there any communication, and is it necessary<br />to communicate with them at all?</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.840" end="00:19:22.460" style="s2">Fighter: No, we have no communication.</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.460" end="00:19:25.180" style="s2">And in general, there can be no communication<br />with them.</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.180" end="00:19:27.140" style="s2">Just as Ukrainians cannot have communication<br />with separatists.</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.140" end="00:19:30.170" style="s2">This is a person who sees everything and participates<br />in the destruction of the Chechen and Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.170" end="00:19:31.170" style="s2">peoples.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.170" end="00:19:33.110" style="s2">He understands everything perfectly, he knows<br />what he is doing.</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.110" end="00:19:35.230" style="s2">There is no point in explaining anything to<br />him and talking to him.</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.230" end="00:19:36.550" style="s2">Interviewer: I know that there were attempts<br />on Kadyrov&#39;s life.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.550" end="00:19:37.550" style="s2">His bodyguard tried to eliminate him.</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.550" end="00:19:41.580" style="s2">That is, there were some movements to overthrow<br />him.</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.580" end="00:19:43.450" style="s2">A fighter: It was a long time ago.</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.450" end="00:19:44.710" style="s2">But it was the initiative of this guy himself.</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.710" end="00:19:45.710" style="s2">Special services found it out.</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.710" end="00:19:48.210" style="s2">He was tortured and beaten for a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.210" end="00:19:52.830" style="s2">According to people, in the end he was fed<br />to a lion.</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.830" end="00:19:58.980" style="s2">Ramzan loves all kinds of zoos there, he has<br />a palace.</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.980" end="00:20:04.560" style="s2">Interviewer: I understand that even if Kadyrov<br />is gone tomorrow, there will still be his</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.560" end="00:20:05.560" style="s2">relatives.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.560" end="00:20:09.000" style="s2">There are a lot of people who are close to<br />him.</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.000" end="00:20:14.820" style="s2">His nephews who are already preparing to take<br />his place after him.</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.820" end="00:20:15.900" style="s2">A fighter: Sure.</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.900" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">There are even his right-hand men, his close<br />ones.</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">There are always traitors who are constantly<br />trying to show themselves, to achieve something.</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:29.350" style="s2">Russia takes traitors from those people whom<br />no one notices during the seizure of territory</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.350" end="00:20:30.470" style="s2">and who are nobody.</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.470" end="00:20:39.170" style="s2">When you give them power and everything in<br />general, they are ready to do anything just</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.170" end="00:20:41.340" style="s2">not to lose it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.340" end="00:20:46.040" style="s2">And they found such people in Ukraine, when<br />they seized the territory, and in Chechnya.</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.040" end="00:20:49.050" style="s2">Interviewer: I heard that his grandfather<br />was also a traitor during the Soviet times.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.050" end="00:20:53.530" style="s2">A fighter: Yes, this is a person who received<br />awards from the Soviet government during the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.530" end="00:20:54.530" style="s2">exile of the people.</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.530" end="00:20:55.530" style="s2">Not combat awards, but during peacetime.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.530" end="00:21:00.170" style="s2">They say that the people were traitors, collaborated<br />with the Nazis, we were not given awards,</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.170" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">but his grandfather received them.</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:07.130" style="s2">Interviewer: In Ukraine, people often laugh<br />at Kadyrov when he says &quot;Don, don, don&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.130" end="00:21:12.550" style="s2">A fighter: In the beginning, after his father<br />died, he became the main puppet, nobody understood</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.550" end="00:21:13.550" style="s2">him at all.</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.550" end="00:21:16.790" style="s2">If you watch his old videos, you will see<br />that he mumbles something and nothing is clear.</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.790" end="00:21:18.130" style="s2">After that he started working on his pronunciation.</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.130" end="00:21:19.610" style="s2">With teachers, most likely, I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.610" end="00:21:21.650" style="s2">But more or less only now it became clear.</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.650" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">But he comes up with some phrases that no<br />one understands - neither Chechens, nor Ukrainians,</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:26.280" style="s2">nor Russians.</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.280" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">Interviewer: Don don this?</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:30.610" style="s2">Fighter: It&#39;s like the word parasite, which<br />means &quot;There is such a thing.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.610" end="00:21:32.680" style="s2">It&#39;s like a confirmation of your words.</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.680" end="00:21:35.220" style="s2">Interviewer: Why do you call it a cradle?</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.220" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">I read that there is such a nickname...</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:39.560" style="s2">A fighter: Lulya, yes, because he is nobody.</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.560" end="00:21:40.560" style="s2">He is not someone either militarily or as<br />a man.</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.560" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">He is just a puppet, the Russian army is behind<br />him.</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:44.520" style="s2">Lyulya is an affectionate and humiliating<br />nickname.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.520" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">As Doku Umarov said, &quot;It&#39;s a pity to waste<br />even a bullet on him.</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:57.230" style="s2">We should throw explosives at him so that<br />he dies of fear&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.230" end="00:22:01.270" style="s2">Interviewer: What are the moods in Grozny<br />now, given the mobilization?</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.270" end="00:22:04.714" style="s2">After they were crushed near Kyiv, mothers,<br />women did not expect this.</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.714" end="00:22:10.930" style="s2">Soldier: You know, there was a video on YouTube,<br />I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s deleted now or not, a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.930" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">woman, when her son was sent back at the beginning<br />of this war said this.</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">She was standing, crying, all the relatives<br />gathered.</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">Women were crying.</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:29.240" style="s2">One could not stand it and started screaming:<br />&quot;If we had rebelled in our time, our sons</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.240" end="00:22:34.670" style="s2">would not be sent to war today&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.670" end="00:22:40.090" style="s2">This is the mood of the people.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.090" end="00:22:45.970" style="s2">Of course, it is very difficult to talk about<br />it there.</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.970" end="00:22:47.740" style="s2">They can take your family.</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.740" end="00:22:53.710" style="s2">When you see that they can do anything with<br />women in your house, with the elderly, with</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.710" end="00:22:54.710" style="s2">children.</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.710" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">People have nothing sacred, no human concepts.</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:22:59.420" style="s2">Obviously, it is difficult for you to do something.</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.420" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">Interviewer: I would like to ask about your<br />actions here, specifically about Dudayev&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">battalion in Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:05.010" style="s2">With the beginning of the full-scale invasion<br />you became an assault group.</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.010" end="00:23:07.720" style="s2">A soldier: It was during the second offensive<br />of the Russian occupation army.</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.720" end="00:23:10.570" style="s2">At first, we worked as a sabotage group, carried<br />out reconnaissance.</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.570" end="00:23:11.960" style="s2">We transmitted data to the artillery.</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.960" end="00:23:16.440" style="s2">When we started to move forward, we became<br />a reconnaissance and assault group.</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.440" end="00:23:22.450" style="s2">Interviewer: You were in Kyiv region and now<br />you were liberating part of Kharkiv region,</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.450" end="00:23:23.450" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.450" end="00:23:28.530" style="s2">Fighter: Emotions are certainly hard to see.</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.530" end="00:23:33.330" style="s2">Civilians, when you walk through a liberated<br />city or village.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.330" end="00:23:48.740" style="s2">It is hard to see these people crying, but<br />they greet you with a smile.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.740" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">On the other hand, you are happy that you<br />are the one who is taking part in this, and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:24:01.800" style="s2">you hope that you will be the one who will<br />end this bloodshed and get to the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.800" end="00:24:02.800" style="s2">all.</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.800" end="00:24:06.730" style="s2">Interviewer: Have you asked yourself the question<br />&quot;Why are you here?</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.730" end="00:24:09.900" style="s2">Why are you fighting in Ukraine?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.900" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">The main motivation.</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:13.010" style="s2">Fighter: Our motivation is freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.010" end="00:24:15.150" style="s2">The freedom of our people.</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.150" end="00:24:22.930" style="s2">I believe that the freedom of the Ukrainian<br />people depends on the freedom of the Chechen</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.930" end="00:24:23.930" style="s2">people.</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.930" end="00:24:29.390" style="s2">We have more in common with the Ukrainian<br />people than with Russians.</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.390" end="00:24:36.510" style="s2">Our mentality is similar, we are ready to<br />give a lot for freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.510" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">There is an Afghan proverb: &quot;When preparing<br />for war, prepare 9 bullets: 8 for traitors,</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:44.710" style="s2">one for the enemy&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.710" end="00:24:47.190" style="s2">The biggest enemy is a traitor.</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.190" end="00:24:55.050" style="s2">From the enemy you know what to expect, you<br />can meet him on the battlefield.</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.050" end="00:24:57.640" style="s2">But a traitor will eat you from the inside.</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:02.810" style="s2">31:43 Interviewer: It was quite difficult<br />to arrange an interview, because the guys</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.810" end="00:25:08.110" style="s2">from Dudayev&#39;s battalion are quite cautious<br />and closed.</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.110" end="00:25:14.520" style="s2">Plus, we had to wait, because they participated<br />in the counteroffensive in Kharkiv region.</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.520" end="00:25:16.460" style="s2">Now we are going to leave.</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.460" end="00:25:19.470" style="s2">This is not a football training, but a military<br />training.</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.470" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">They say it will be very interesting, but<br />we need to travel a bit.</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">I will not say where we are going, it is a<br />matter of security, it is clear.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:33.430" style="s2">Before that, we will stop at the gas station.</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.430" end="00:25:40.150" style="s2">By the way, now, choosing any service, I analyze<br />how this company behaves during the war.</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.150" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">OKKO, where we are now stopping, is very proactive<br />in terms of how they support our army, our</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:26:00.510" style="s2">soldiers, and this is extremely important<br />now.</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.510" end="00:26:11.010" style="s2">For you to understand, since the beginning<br />of the full-scale war, this company has allocated</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.010" end="00:26:14.450" style="s2">more than 120 million hryvnias for various<br />charitable projects.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.450" end="00:26:16.910" style="s2">One of such projects is &quot;Warming the defenders&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.910" end="00:26:23.850" style="s2">Since the first days of the war OKKO has been<br />treating defenders for free near the hot spots.</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.850" end="00:26:31.260" style="s2">OKKO prepared more than 300 thousand servings<br />of coffee and 200 thousand hot dogs for our</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.260" end="00:26:32.260" style="s2">military.</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.260" end="00:26:37.110" style="s2">They often do not have the opportunity to<br />spend much time to have a snack.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.110" end="00:26:43.280" style="s2">Therefore, such a quick and tasty snack at<br />the gas station can recharge the military</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.280" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">forces to continue to defend the country.</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:48.860" style="s2">By the way, friends.</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.860" end="00:26:53.590" style="s2">Each of you can transfer your points from<br />the application &quot;Chip&quot; for coffee and hot</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.590" end="00:26:54.590" style="s2">dogs for our heroes.</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.590" end="00:26:58.360" style="s2">This can be done very simply in the mobile<br />application or connect a cashier and he will</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.390" end="00:27:02.820" style="s2">We respect the companies that proactively<br />behave in the context of supporting our army.</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.750" end="00:27:24.750" style="s2">The title is MAGA.</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.750" end="00:27:25.750" style="s2">A fighter: Yes, of course.</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.750" end="00:27:27.920" style="s2">You get tired much faster on the battlefield.</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.920" end="00:27:29.980" style="s2">We are slowly preparing ourselves.</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.980" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">We also prepare new recruits for the same<br />conditions.</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:38.730" style="s2">They walk and shoot nearby to make them feel<br />closer to combat conditions.</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.730" end="00:27:41.270" style="s2">Firecrackers are like explosions nearby.</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.270" end="00:27:45.640" style="s2">Of course, it is difficult to compare with<br />a real battle, but more or less a person will</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.640" end="00:27:47.030" style="s2">be ready for stress.</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.030" end="00:27:54.510" style="s2">35:10 Interviewer: Your previous generation,<br />who fought in the first and second Chechen</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.510" end="00:28:00.520" style="s2">wars, is an example for you.</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.520" end="00:28:06.540" style="s2">They had no time to prepare.</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.540" end="00:28:10.990" style="s2">A fighter: Yes, they had nothing: no weapons,<br />nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.990" end="00:28:17.340" style="s2">They won these battles purely due to their<br />spirit and went to the end.</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.340" end="00:28:24.710" style="s2">Today it is essentially a very easy war for<br />us.</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.710" end="00:28:28.890" style="s2">Looking at them, I would be ashamed to sit<br />somewhere.</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.890" end="00:28:35.040" style="s2">Because this whole history of our people is<br />built on the resistance to the occupier.</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.040" end="00:28:40.890" style="s2">All our heroes who exist and existed - they<br />all fought against this empire.</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.890" end="00:28:45.860" style="s2">We do not have a single hero who fought somewhere<br />else.</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.860" end="00:28:47.530" style="s2">Everyone fought against this occupier.</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.530" end="00:28:52.760" style="s2">35:56 Interviewer: You told me that during<br />the Chechen war there was a moment when people</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.760" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">asked Dudayev &quot;Where are our weapons?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:56.300" style="s2">A fighter: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.300" end="00:28:58.660" style="s2">Interviewer: And what did he say?</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.660" end="00:29:05.770" style="s2">A fighter: The answer was: the Russian army<br />is coming, they have a lot of weapons, take</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.770" end="00:29:06.770" style="s2">them away.</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.770" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">No one started to resent it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">They accepted it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:21.010" style="s2">And they began to take weapons from the dead<br />occupiers, or simply take them from the living.</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.010" end="00:29:28.510" style="s2">In Grozny, there were battles: a video where<br />a crowd of people is running after a Russian</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.510" end="00:29:30.460" style="s2">to take away weapons.</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.460" end="00:29:33.860" style="s2">Interviewer: Still so strong in battle, why?</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.860" end="00:29:37.740" style="s2">A fighter: You know, it&#39;s in our blood.</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.740" end="00:29:43.250" style="s2">Our ancestors fought, it is in our genes to<br />fight for our freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.250" end="00:29:44.250" style="s2">Just like Ukrainians.</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.250" end="00:29:47.320" style="s2">Europe did not expect that Ukraine would survive.</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.320" end="00:29:52.780" style="s2">Many who fled Ukraine thought that it was<br />the end.</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.780" end="00:29:59.730" style="s2">But Ukrainians proved that they can fight<br />even before the support from Europe.</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.730" end="00:30:08.730" style="s2">And Europe helped only when Ukraine had already<br />defended most of the areas at the front.</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.730" end="00:30:18.580" style="s2">Where it stopped the army and the occupiers<br />retreated.</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.580" end="00:30:19.580" style="s2">.</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.580" end="00:30:25.060" style="s2">Interviewer: What will the mobilization in<br />the Russian Federation change now?</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.060" end="00:30:28.920" style="s2">You are talking now with people who are in<br />Ichkeria.</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.920" end="00:30:33.970" style="s2">What do you think it will change?</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.970" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">A fighter: More blood.</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:40.590" style="s2">This will change the fact that they want to<br />reduce as much as possible the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.590" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">who will go to the resistance.</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:48.090" style="s2">Kadyrov&#39;s loyalists are not the first to go.</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.090" end="00:30:51.030" style="s2">For example, the husbands of women who protested,<br />they will go first.</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.030" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">We tell those people who are forcibly sending<br />others that they can surrender, that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:00.490" style="s2">will be treated well.</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.490" end="00:31:02.520" style="s2">It is not like being captured by the Russian<br />occupier.</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.520" end="00:31:08.510" style="s2">Of course, they are told that they are tortured<br />and killed there.</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.510" end="00:31:16.470" style="s2">There was such a case: Kadyrovites were shown<br />a video of Ukrainians torturing Russian prisoners.</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.470" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">Then they showed a video where they cut Russian<br />soldiers.</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.450" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">A Kadyrovite who was sitting in the back said:<br />&quot;Oh, that&#39;s my uncle&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:28.620" style="s2">These same Kadyrovites themselves stain Chechens.</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.620" end="00:31:34.830" style="s2">They cut off the heads ofjournalists, they<br />were not found.</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.830" end="00:31:43.890" style="s2">Kadyrovites serve Russia in order to blacken<br />the name of Chechens, among other things.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.890" end="00:31:46.120" style="s2">Interviewer: Do your people have a sense of<br />blood revenge?</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.120" end="00:31:50.200" style="s2">That is, when Ichkeria is liberated, will<br />you figure out who was doing what?</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.200" end="00:31:51.299" style="s2">A fighter: Of course.</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.299" end="00:31:53.610" style="s2">Our ancestors made these mistakes every time.</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.610" end="00:31:58.850" style="s2">No matter how much Russia tries to denigrate<br />us, to say how terrible and terrible we are,</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.850" end="00:32:01.560" style="s2">but at the moment when victory has come, everyone<br />does not want to kill anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.560" end="00:32:04.280" style="s2">They want peace and finally to leave it all<br />behind, to live a peaceful life.</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.280" end="00:32:05.860" style="s2">Each time the same thing was repeated.</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.860" end="00:32:06.980" style="s2">We left these traitors...</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.980" end="00:32:09.230" style="s2">We are one people, we must live together.</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.230" end="00:32:10.360" style="s2">We talked to them.</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.360" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">Everything was forgotten.</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:13.230" style="s2">And then Russia prepared the same people.</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.230" end="00:32:14.230" style="s2">They sowed discord.</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.230" end="00:32:15.230" style="s2">And it all started again.</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.230" end="00:32:16.780" style="s2">Therefore, we must get rid of traitors by<br />any means.</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.780" end="00:32:18.140" style="s2">There is no other way out.</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.140" end="00:32:20.630" style="s2">No nation has ever gained freedom without<br />getting rid of traitors.</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.630" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">There is no such thing.</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:23.110" style="s2">Traitors today betray and will betray again.</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.110" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">Such people cannot be trusted.</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:27.020" style="s2">The occupiers themselves write in the document<br />&quot;prone to betrayal&quot; on the people who work</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.020" end="00:32:28.020" style="s2">for them.</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.020" end="00:32:29.049" style="s2">They themselves do not perceive them as people.</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.049" end="00:32:31.290" style="s2">These are people who, if anything, are ready<br />to switch sides.</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.290" end="00:32:32.900" style="s2">Interviewer: Are you ready to take into the<br />battalion those people who were mobilized</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.900" end="00:32:33.900" style="s2">but surrendered?</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.900" end="00:32:34.900" style="s2">Theoretically.</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.900" end="00:32:35.900" style="s2">Fighter: Yes, of course, only will be checked.</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.900" end="00:32:37.770" style="s2">Where, what, did you participate in the Chechen<br />war on the side of the occupiers?</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.770" end="00:32:39.250" style="s2">Were the fighters in the resistance?</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.250" end="00:32:41.330" style="s2">All this will be taken into account.</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.330" end="00:32:43.410" style="s2">There must be strict control over this.</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.410" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">Interviewer: Did you talk about this in your<br />battalion?</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:46.679" style="s2">A fighter: Of course.</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.679" end="00:32:48.910" style="s2">And if people who were sent here by threatening<br />their families.</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.910" end="00:32:51.080" style="s2">In captivity they will be exchanged and sent<br />back home.</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.080" end="00:32:54.470" style="s2">So what is better for them - to die defenseless<br />among the occupiers or to die defending freedom</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.470" end="00:32:55.470" style="s2">of speech?</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.470" end="00:32:57.010" style="s2">A dead lion is more valuable than a live jackal.</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.010" end="00:32:59.690" style="s2">Interviewer: Is your dream to return to Free<br />Ichkeria?</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.690" end="00:33:05.990" style="s2">I am a fighter: I am the son of a fighter<br />who fought in the first and second Chechen</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.990" end="00:33:06.990" style="s2">war.</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.990" end="00:33:07.990" style="s2">I continue the work of my father.</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.990" end="00:33:10.090" style="s2">We will all continue to fight.</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.090" end="00:33:17.750" style="s2">If my generation cannot do it, the next one<br />will.</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.750" end="00:33:24.270" style="s2">We will do everything to stop it on my generation.</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.270" end="00:33:32.760" style="s2">We have achieved freedom and security for<br />Ukrainians, Chechens and other peoples who</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.760" end="00:33:35.370" style="s2">are now under occupation.</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.370" end="00:33:40.110" style="s2">Join us, fight for your freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.110" end="00:33:57.890" style="s2">It is difficult to take, it has a high price.</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.890" end="00:34:34.280" style="s2">43:20 Interviewer: Looking at how Ukraine<br />is supported by Europe, America, the whole</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.280" end="00:34:45.429" style="s2">I think that in your head and in your people<br />there is such an opinion that &quot;if we were</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.429" end="00:34:49.139" style="s2">given such support, we would tear the Muscovites<br />apart.</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.139" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">Fighter: If we had such help then, there would<br />not be such bloodshed in Ukraine today, because</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:57.640" style="s2">Russia would not be able to go further.</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.640" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">There would be no terrible illusions that<br />they are so terrible, destroying everything.</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:02.460" style="s2">It would have been a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.460" end="00:35:04.369" style="s2">state that lost to the Chechens.</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.369" end="00:35:05.840" style="s2">And Ukrainians would not have perceived them<br />as a threat.</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.840" end="00:35:08.260" style="s2">They would not have been able to crush them<br />morally.</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.230" end="00:35:42.109" style="s2">And drop a link to the cool tiktok of the<br />Kadyrovites and describe what the catch is,</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.109" end="00:35:45.150" style="s2">The best option is to take a book, so let&#39;s<br />get involved.</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.150" end="00:35:48.020" style="s2">There is a lot of material.</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.020" end="00:35:53.340" style="s2">Interviewer: At the same time, Northeast,<br />we talked to you, the Chechens captured just</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.340" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">people who were sitting there.</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:56.630" style="s2">What kind of action was it?</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.630" end="00:35:58.970" style="s2">It&#39;s not a setup, it&#39;s really your people.</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.970" end="00:36:01.190" style="s2">A fighter: It was an action of desperation.</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.190" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">Because every time they seized different buildings,<br />there was only one demand</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:05.540" style="s2">- to withdraw troops from Chechnya.</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.540" end="00:36:10.230" style="s2">They did not ask for money, they did not even<br />ask to let them go.</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.230" end="00:36:14.080" style="s2">They wanted the withdrawal of troops to save<br />their people from destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.080" end="00:36:17.070" style="s2">They did not want their people to live in<br />slavery.</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.070" end="00:36:19.960" style="s2">They were ready to sacrifice their lives.</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.960" end="00:36:21.950" style="s2">Of course, the world perceived it as terrorism.</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.950" end="00:36:22.950" style="s2">The world refused to support us.</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.950" end="00:36:24.140" style="s2">It was easier for them to just recognize us<br />as terrorists.</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.140" end="00:36:28.210" style="s2">The world hoped back then, as always in history,<br />that Russia would change.</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.210" end="00:36:30.780" style="s2">It has never changed in its history.</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.780" end="00:36:32.410" style="s2">It will not change.</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.410" end="00:36:34.790" style="s2">Ukraine sees and feels it today.</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.790" end="00:36:35.790" style="s2">46:20 President of Ichkeria:</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.790" end="00:36:38.390" style="s2">Ordinary Russism is worse than fascism and<br />Nazism, racism, all human ideologies that</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.390" end="00:36:39.390" style="s2">are built on hatred.</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.390" end="00:36:41.730" style="s2">They are nurtured by the highest rank of Russian<br />statehood.</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.730" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">Russians believe neither in Christ, nor in<br />Mohammed, nor in Buda, nor in anyone.</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:48.280" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.280" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">Kep - Fighter: First of all, this is a group<br />I knew before the war.</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:51.000" style="s2">They are friends.</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.000" end="00:36:54.660" style="s2">Not much has changed since the beginning of<br />the war.</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.660" end="00:36:58.610" style="s2">It&#39;s just that this team was militarized and<br />became one big unit.</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.610" end="00:36:59.910" style="s2">It is this battalion.</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.910" end="00:37:02.440" style="s2">Historically, my friends, their parents, they<br />are from Ichkeria.</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.440" end="00:37:05.020" style="s2">Their fathers fought in the first and second<br />campaigns.</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.020" end="00:37:10.650" style="s2">Obviously, with the beginning of the war here,<br />it became a battalion unit.</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.650" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">By this coincidence, I am now here with my<br />friends.</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">47:20 Interviewer: What did the representatives<br />of Ichkeria teach you in terms of life philosophy,</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:22.060" style="s2">because these people are always very deep,<br />from those I know.</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.060" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">What exactly did they teach you?</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:27.400" style="s2">A fighter: Discipline is the main thing I<br />took from these people.</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.400" end="00:37:28.860" style="s2">Purity of spirit and intentions.</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.860" end="00:37:30.600" style="s2">It is everywhere and in everything.</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.600" end="00:37:36.550" style="s2">These people are absolutely transparent and<br />without guile in their actions.</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.550" end="00:37:39.430" style="s2">There is something to learn from them in terms<br />of discipline, self-control.</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.430" end="00:37:43.140" style="s2">The philosophy of views on life is also common.</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.140" end="00:37:44.260" style="s2">Attitude to death and life.</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.260" end="00:37:46.030" style="s2">For these people, death is an everyday thing.</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.030" end="00:37:48.500" style="s2">They do not find in it something that an ordinary<br />person is in a stupor.</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.500" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">For them, it is just perishability, all life<br />is a moment that passes and is followed by</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:53.250" style="s2">the next life that a person deserves.</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.250" end="00:37:57.080" style="s2">Either paradise or hyena, which a person will<br />feed himself.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.080" end="00:38:01.460" style="s2">Therefore, I borrowed the lightness of attitude<br />to death from these people.</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.460" end="00:38:06.260" style="s2">The most important thing for me was to emphasize<br />that life is a moment that you just need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.260" end="00:38:09.080" style="s2">live with dignity, to go this way with dignity.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.080" end="00:38:16.020" style="s2">And then go to where my place will be in the<br />next life.</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.020" end="00:38:20.040" style="s2">Our battalion, our group is international:<br />mostly Chechens, Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars,</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.040" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">Azerbaijanis.</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:24.420" style="s2">There are people representing other nationalities<br />who want to join us.</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.420" end="00:38:28.440" style="s2">Here no one divides anyone into nations, races<br />and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.440" end="00:38:32.100" style="s2">People here are united by one idea and one<br />incentive</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.100" end="00:38:34.700" style="s2">to fight for freedom and independence of their<br />nations.</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.700" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">But now Ukraine is an opportunity to realize<br />our plans.</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:43.090" style="s2">That is, here we can all prove ourselves,<br />our ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.090" end="00:38:47.420" style="s2">To achieve freedom of our peoples with one<br />common fist.</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.420" end="00:38:53.990" style="s2">So that sooner or later these people could<br />come to their land and return their traditions</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.990" end="00:38:55.600" style="s2">that have been there for centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.600" end="00:38:59.300" style="s2">But with the advent of Putin&#39;s power everywhere<br />there is absolute chaos, violence, destruction</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.300" end="00:39:00.300" style="s2">of peoples.</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.300" end="00:39:04.300" style="s2">In order to defeat the common enemy, it is<br />necessary to unite, consolidate the peoples.</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.300" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">Therefore, I would advise all people who watch<br />us only one thing: to find like-minded people,</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:12.250" style="s2">people close in spirit, to take up arms, to<br />come and just fight for freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.250" end="00:39:14.001" style="s2">Because if there is no resistance here, the<br />war will go on and on.</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.001" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">To other regions, to other countries.</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:20.700" style="s2">I advise everyone only one thing: to fight<br />for freedom and independence, to adhere to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.700" end="00:39:23.350" style="s2">their ideals, to follow their own path.</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.350" end="00:39:28.680" style="s2">I would advise young people: read, develop,<br />take the right path and keep going.</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.680" end="00:39:29.770" style="s2">50:29 President of Ichkeria:</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.770" end="00:39:33.850" style="s2">In vain Russians think that now they will<br />intimidate the world, humanity with their</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.850" end="00:39:35.390" style="s2">army, criminal authorities, nuclear weapons.</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.390" end="00:39:36.630" style="s2">They will not intimidate.</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.630" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">50:39 Interviewer: Now your people are being<br />persecuted again, thrown at us.</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:45.010" style="s2">That is, there is this population that still<br />lives on the territory of Ichkeria.</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.010" end="00:39:47.720" style="s2">It is under the regime of Kadyrov.</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.720" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">This is a totalitarian regime.</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">I know that for any criticism they simply<br />take people to the forest and beat them, mock</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:56.740" style="s2">them, then make them say on camera that &quot;Shaitan<br />confused&quot; and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.740" end="00:39:58.920" style="s2">There are people who protest against this<br />mobilization.</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.920" end="00:40:03.320" style="s2">I often hear such words as &quot;Why won&#39;t Chechnya<br />stand up?&quot;, because I understand that no one</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.320" end="00:40:04.840" style="s2">wants to go here and fight.</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.840" end="00:40:09.130" style="s2">They are now mobilizing people, many representatives<br />of your nationality have already been killed.</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.130" end="00:40:10.660" style="s2">What to do with this?</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.660" end="00:40:15.010" style="s2">Is there a chance that people will stand up<br />and remove Kadyrov?</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.010" end="00:40:17.800" style="s2">Or is everyone so intimidated that there is<br />no point in standing up?</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.800" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">A fighter: Look.</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:21.140" style="s2">When I am asked this question, I ask a counter<br />question.</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.140" end="00:40:25.050" style="s2">When I am asked: &quot;Why is there no uprising<br />in Chechnya, Dagestan, somewhere else&quot;, I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.050" end="00:40:28.320" style="s2">always ask a question: &quot;Why is there no uprising<br />in Donetsk?</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.320" end="00:40:29.320" style="s2">Luhansk?</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.320" end="00:40:30.320" style="s2">Kherson?</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.320" end="00:40:31.320" style="s2">In Melitopol?</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.320" end="00:40:32.320" style="s2">In Mariupol?</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.320" end="00:40:33.320" style="s2">Why is there no uprising there?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.320" end="00:40:34.320" style="s2">You see, the Chechen people lost 300 thousand.</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.320" end="00:40:37.190" style="s2">It&#39;s like 14 million Ukrainians would have<br />died out of 40 million.</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.190" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">The regime that is there now...</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:47.840" style="s2">Yes, the Russian army is stolen, corrupted,<br />it is not the second army of the world, but</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.840" end="00:40:50.950" style="s2">Russian bodies like the FSB, the Ministry<br />of Internal Affairs, believe me, they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.950" end="00:40:51.950" style="s2">very strong.</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.950" end="00:40:55.560" style="s2">They have created such terror, such horror<br />in the occupied territories, because I talked</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.560" end="00:40:58.280" style="s2">to those Ukrainians who left Mariupol, Melitopol.</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.280" end="00:41:01.230" style="s2">What they tell me is just horror...</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.230" end="00:41:06.210" style="s2">Those who ask such questions should go there<br />at least once and live either in Chechnya,</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.210" end="00:41:11.350" style="s2">or in Melitopol, or in Mariupol for at least<br />a week.</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.350" end="00:41:13.460" style="s2">This question will immediately disappear.</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.460" end="00:41:18.109" style="s2">If there is such a cruel, terrible, cannibalistic<br />regime in Chechnya today...</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.109" end="00:41:20.670" style="s2">The last thing they have to do is to take<br />the dissatisfied and throw them into boiling</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.670" end="00:41:21.670" style="s2">vats of oil in the center of Grozny.</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.670" end="00:41:22.670" style="s2">They have already done everything else.</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.670" end="00:41:26.080" style="s2">They have already applied all executions and<br />tortures to Chechens.</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.080" end="00:41:27.619" style="s2">Chechnya is in fact a huge concentration camp.</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.619" end="00:41:28.740" style="s2">A huge terrible concentration camp.</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.740" end="00:41:31.590" style="s2">There was a rally in Grozny, about 120 women<br />turned out.</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.590" end="00:41:37.000" style="s2">Kadyrov, not knowing what else to do, said<br />that all male relatives of these women would</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.000" end="00:41:39.990" style="s2">go to Ukraine to fight without any training.</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.990" end="00:41:47.780" style="s2">If he knows how, if he does not know how - it<br />does not matter, he will be thrown to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.780" end="00:41:48.780" style="s2">front line.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.780" end="00:41:54.020" style="s2">They will choose the place where the Ukrainian<br />artillery best blows up the positions, send</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.020" end="00:41:57.090" style="s2">him there and tell him to die.</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.090" end="00:41:58.420" style="s2">And he will die.</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.420" end="00:41:59.420" style="s2">This is fate.</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.420" end="00:42:04.369" style="s2">I constantly give Europeans an example of<br />Chechens who are mobilized here.</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.369" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">I say &quot;if Ukraine was captured, believe me:<br />they would send here not only 10 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:11.110" style="s2">Chechens out of 800 thousand.</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.110" end="00:42:16.330" style="s2">Imagine how many people they would have armed<br />with Mosin rifles and easily sent them to</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.330" end="00:42:17.580" style="s2">Poland, Romania, Slovakia&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.580" end="00:42:21.170" style="s2">They would claim that the Ukrainian People&#39;s<br />Republic, for example, is doing it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.170" end="00:42:27.000" style="s2">The Russians would again have nothing to do<br />with it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.000" end="00:42:29.770" style="s2">This is the fate of faithful torn peoples.</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.770" end="00:42:33.570" style="s2">Among Chechens there are some idiots who believe<br />in all this Kadyrov&#39;s nonsense.</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.570" end="00:42:35.930" style="s2">But there are few of them.</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.930" end="00:42:38.810" style="s2">Ukraine should somehow respond to this.</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.810" end="00:42:43.130" style="s2">It would be very nice if they recognized independence.</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.130" end="00:42:46.010" style="s2">Now they are holding a referendum.</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.010" end="00:42:47.010" style="s2">That&#39;s good.</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.010" end="00:42:51.890" style="s2">Donbas, Luhansk, Kherson peoples do not exist<br />in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.890" end="00:42:55.000" style="s2">But there are Chechen, Tatar, Yakut peoples.</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:42:57.630" style="s2">But according to Bandera, &quot;free peoples have<br />free countries&quot;.</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.750" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">Is it the victory of Ukraine, the collapse<br />of Russia, the independence of these nations?</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:11.130" style="s2">Fighter: The ideal scenario for us is that<br />Ukraine becomes a moderator of the former</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.540" end="00:53:13.950" style="s2">1:13:41 Soldiers: But for the donations you<br />gave us for fuel we came to a wonderful village,</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.950" end="00:53:16.810" style="s2">which was under occupation until today.</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.810" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">Now it is not anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:22.560" style="s2">Keep sending us money, we will be very grateful<br />to you.</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.560" end="00:53:26.040" style="s2">With each donation, more and more people will<br />be free.</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.040" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">Amen.</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:30.130" style="s2">1:13:58 Interviewer: You know, now more and<br />more often I catch myself thinking that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.130" end="00:53:35.940" style="s2">are living in war, while, for example, in<br />Italy people think about football, go shopping,</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.940" end="00:53:36.940" style="s2">enjoy life.</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.940" end="00:53:38.780" style="s2">Your people are the same.</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.780" end="00:53:43.830" style="s2">The French did not believe Ukrainians who<br />talked about Russians.</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.830" end="00:53:46.970" style="s2">&quot;These are 19th century methods,&quot; - they said.</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.970" end="00:53:49.930" style="s2">Why is there such injustice in the world?</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.930" end="00:53:54.150" style="s2">Someone lives peacefully, and we are under<br />this pressure.</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.150" end="00:53:58.380" style="s2">A fighter: Let&#39;s look at it from the other<br />side.</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.380" end="00:54:04.730" style="s2">For the first time in history, the Ukrainian<br />army defended Kyiv, the capital, chases the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.730" end="00:54:08.730" style="s2">enemy, reduces the number of occupied territories,<br />expands the liberated territories.</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.730" end="00:54:10.730" style="s2">Interviewer: The price of all this?</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.730" end="00:54:11.730" style="s2">Human lives.</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.730" end="00:54:12.730" style="s2">A fighter: Okay.</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.730" end="00:54:13.730" style="s2">The world is a cruel place.</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.730" end="00:54:18.270" style="s2">A man is born in agony and dies not of his<br />own free will.</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.270" end="00:54:21.330" style="s2">There are values above comfort, good car,<br />house, beer.</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.330" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">For these values there is a price that Ukraine<br />pays.</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:28.890" style="s2">Interviewer: Why do our peoples pay it?</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.890" end="00:54:29.890" style="s2">A fighter: Historically.</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.890" end="00:54:39.020" style="s2">We did not unite against the Russians many<br />centuries ago.</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.020" end="00:54:52.290" style="s2">If we had not allowed the Russians to expand<br />their empire, we would not be sitting here</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.290" end="00:55:17.060" style="s2">in front of the cameras, we would be sitting<br />in </p>
<p begin="00:55:17.060" end="00:55:21.510" style="s2">a football stadium.</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.510" end="00:55:30.250" style="s2">Now we have to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.250" end="00:55:46.839" style="s2">So that our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren<br />do not ask each other this question.</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.839" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">Someone has to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:54.090" style="s2">Everyone fought for their history: Italy,<br />Germany, Britain.</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.090" end="00:55:57.849" style="s2">Interviewer: But we are constantly struggling...</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.849" end="00:56:04.930" style="s2">Fighter: Neither you nor we have won the empire<br />completely.</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.930" end="00:56:09.360" style="s2">Interviewer: It will be endless.</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.360" end="00:56:14.890" style="s2">Putin will die, a new generation will be born.</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.890" end="00:56:27.950" style="s2">A fighter: That is why we are here.</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.950" end="00:56:38.150" style="s2">To build everything on our example, on the<br />example of Belarusians.</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.150" end="00:56:43.170" style="s2">Russia without national regions is small.</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.170" end="00:56:48.260" style="s2">This process should be completed with the<br />complete demilitarization of Russia.</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.260" end="00:56:51.480" style="s2">Police and internal troops and that&#39;s all.</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.480" end="00:57:00.690" style="s2">It should not be like in Germany.</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.690" end="00:57:09.390" style="s2">We must not allow the opposition to power<br />in the same way, because they profess imperialism.</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.390" end="00:57:12.290" style="s2">Russia should be divided into sectors.</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.290" end="00:57:14.700" style="s2">Denazification should be carried out.</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.700" end="00:57:18.089" style="s2">It always attacks, it does not defend.</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.089" end="00:57:36.930" style="s2">I want to say a big thank you to the Ukrainian<br />authorities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine,</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.930" end="00:57:39.190" style="s2">the Ukrainian people for what they do.</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.190" end="00:57:47.910" style="s2">It is a source of pride.</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.910" end="00:58:01.950" style="s2">It is an honor to be with you <br />at this moment.</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.950" end="00:58:09.140" style="s2">Without you we have little chance to liberate<br />our homeland, and without us you have little</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.140" end="00:58:13.890" style="s2">chance to live long in a peaceful country.</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.890" end="00:58:17.160" style="s2">Because they will return on any pretext in<br />any case.</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.160" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">It is inevitable.</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:20.099" style="s2">Interviewer: Will there be a second war after<br />the first one?</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.099" end="00:58:21.099" style="s2">A fighter: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.099" end="00:58:22.099" style="s2">Absolutely.</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.099" end="00:58:39.859" style="s2">If the dispossessed peoples do not get freedom,<br />Russia will return, and we will have little</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.859" end="00:58:40.859" style="s2">chance.</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.859" end="00:58:45.180" style="s2">Russia must be in its historical borders.</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.180" end="00:58:48.720" style="s2">We are not cannibals.</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.720" end="00:58:50.710" style="s2">They are.</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.710" end="00:58:53.690" style="s2">We just want to live freely.</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.690" end="00:58:59.260" style="s2">Dear friends, I hope you found this material<br />interesting, you can let me know in the comments.</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.260" end="00:59:02.359" style="s2">Very deep thoughts about our nations.</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.359" end="00:59:04.210" style="s2">Ukrainian and Nakh.</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.210" end="00:59:16.770" style="s2">How much Russia oppressed us for centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.770" end="00:59:32.890" style="s2">I am not surprised that these guys are</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.890" end="00:59:33.890" style="s2">with us now.</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.890" end="00:59:42.760" style="s2">I invite you to support the petition to the<br />President of Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.760" end="01:00:05.841" style="s2">To recognize the independence of the Republic<br />of Ichkeria.</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.841" end="01:00:27.450" style="s2">The link is in </p>
<p begin="01:00:27.450" end="01:00:28.450" style="s2">the description.</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.450" end="01:00:33.130" style="s2">It is the easiest thing you can do.</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.130" end="01:00:36.990" style="s2">Dear Ukrainians!</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.990" end="01:01:10.620" style="s2">We have united with our brotherly nations<br />against the common enemy who is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.620" end="01:01:16.680" style="s2">destroy us.</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.680" end="01:01:48.150" style="s2">All Crimean Tatars who were mobilized, I suggest<br />you </p>
<p begin="01:01:48.150" end="01:01:49.150" style="s2">to surrender.</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.150" end="01:02:06.609" style="s2">We <br />will come soon to our lands.</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.609" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">Greetings to all the people of Ichkeria.</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">I <br />want to appeal to all mobilized guys who were</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">brought here by force.</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:28.359" style="s2">Surrender.</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.890" end="01:02:50.890" style="s2">Come to our side.</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.840" end="01:03:32.360" style="s2">The journalist Yelena Milashina, who is very<br />unpleasant to me, also sits in the interview</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.360" end="01:03:37.960" style="s2">with Sobchak and says: &quot;That&#39;s it, Chechen<br />ways and laws are</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.960" end="01:03:40.760" style="s2">destroyed, we have broken them&quot;.</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.760" end="01:03:43.200" style="s2">Sobchak asks her if it is true, and she says<br />&quot;yes&quot;.</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.200" end="01:03:48.040" style="s2">I showed them a gesture.</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.040" end="01:04:25.600" style="s2">The fact that we are here, hundreds of thousands<br />of people like us can show them what they broke us.</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.600" end="01:04:30.840" style="s2">The Soviet government broke us for 70 years.</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.320" end="01:04:33.360" style="s2">People read our Korans in basements so that<br />no one could see.</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.360" end="01:04:42.040" style="s2">They mocked us as much as they could, until<br />89 they were sure that they finally succeeded.</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.040" end="01:04:49.280" style="s2">We assimilated, became like them, because<br />they raised a sufficient number of Chechen</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.280" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">intellectuals for whom Russian was their native<br />language.</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:04:58.240" style="s2">Dzhokhar Dudayev came and said: &quot;Let&#39;s go&quot;.</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.240" end="01:05:00.240" style="s2">And we go.</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.240" end="01:05:03.960" style="s2">We always broke them in their stories.</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.960" end="01:05:06.240" style="s2">We had a national hero.</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.240" end="01:05:08.320" style="s2">Baysangur of Benuela.</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.320" end="01:05:40.120" style="s2">There was a legend that he was born after<br />the death of Sheikh Mansour.</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.120" end="01:05:42.200" style="s2">We do not give up and you do not give up.</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.200" end="01:05:44.200" style="s2">It is impossible.</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.200" end="01:05:50.880" style="s2">That is why all Russians, those who are for<br />you, those who are against you, politicians,</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.880" end="01:05:55.840" style="s2">oppositionists - think the same about you<br />and us.</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.840" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">But they are wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.600" end="01:22:16.328" style="s2">Russians have been destroying our history<br />for centuries, it is a sin to die for them.</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.360" end="01:22:19.520" style="s2">We will liberate our land.</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.520" end="01:22:22.800" style="s2">Glory to the nation!</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.800" end="01:22:25.000" style="s2">Death to enemies!</p>
